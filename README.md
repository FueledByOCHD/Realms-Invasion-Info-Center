Welcome to the public infomation database for all things Realms. Realms is a [WIP](https://github.com/FueledByOCHD/Realms-Invasion-Info-Center/blob/develop/WorkInProgress.md) project which means that things are subject to change alot as time passes, I ask that you keep checking because things are subject to some major changes as time passes.
