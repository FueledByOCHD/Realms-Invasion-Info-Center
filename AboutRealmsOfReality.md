### **Overview**

Realms of Reality is a Role Playing Lore set built around being used in Classless Skill Based RPG games. Realms of Reality tries to use as close to real world logic, like gravity and much more to provide a very unique user experience that can be discribed as 'A Realms of Reality' game.

### **The Realms Experience**

Realms of Reality's biggest focus on allowing players to play the way they want without enforcing any wierd restrictions like Classes. For example, Just because your 'Primary' occupation is a 'Wizard' for example does not mean that you are unable to use a sword. Instead with Realms you will only be able to use some spells and abilities while a sword is equipped, as well as inability to use other spells due to having the said sword equipped.

Realms of Reality focuses on a task based skill system which means the more you use do a take the better you become at it. This applies to everything from, Skills, Jobs, ect..

### **History**

Realms of Reality is the revival of an old board game lore set that I developed while in high school. This lore will not be the exact same as the old Lore set, but instead will be an evolution of some core concepts from the original 'Realms of the Mind' board game lore set, which unfortunantly has all been destroied or lost. That is all but what I was able to keep stored in my brain all this time. I welcome you to follow along with me as I bring this evolution to life. I even invite you to join the community and get involved in helping me along the way.

### **Notes**

Realms of Reality is in a raw state and on **Temp** Hold while I develop out [Realms Invasion 'Projects'](https://github.com/FueledByOCHD/Realms-Invasion-Info-Center/blob/develop/Tools/Projects/RI_Projects.md) Sorry for the inconvience. This is to allow us to much easier develop due to one of the main features planned is to able to design lore.
