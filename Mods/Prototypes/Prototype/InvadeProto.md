### **About**

Invade 'Prototype' is the active 'Simi-Typed' mod which is meant to be the complete basic Prototype of the Realms Invasion Modset. The reason for this is to give me time to develop out my ideas in a simi-typed manner to allow for quicker development of Idea basics. 

**Key Features:**
|Name|Desc|
|:---|:---|
|Item Components|A custom overhaul which is meant to make items more "Unique" to allow for much more unique experience when dealing with items|
|Item Breakdown|A custom overhaul which is built ontop of the Items Components to give a more diverse system for breaking down items|
|Item Craft|A custom overhaul of the Item crafting sytem which is built not using Recipes and is built to take advantage of Item Components|
