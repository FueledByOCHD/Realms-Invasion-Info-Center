### **What is Project Realms**

Project Realms is my personal project of bringing to life a custom lore set that can be used as the basis for trying to develop worlds that are able to feel as close to living and breathing as possible with the intention of creating a online user experience. Along with a Horror surivial game which is meant to be online as well as offline.

### **Long Term Goals**

Some of the goals I have are below, know that they are not in any order and some are even [partially developed] but I'm wanting to gain more experience into game development I'm taking time to develop my own custom Project management application to allow myself to more effectivly develop them later down the road.

#### **Ancient Majik Tech**

I want to eventually create a game development company to allow me to protect my work as well as possible give other people a place to work to help me accieve my goals.

#### **Realms of Reality Lore**

I plan on making a Lore set much like that of Blizard's DND, but Realms of Reality will be more tailored to 3D RPG games with a classless 'Skill based' system.

#### **Quick Reaction Force**

Quick Reaction Force will be a 3D voxel Horror survival RPG Simulation based on a special event within the Realms of Reality lore.

#### **Realms Engine**

Realms Engine will be a component based game engine which will be used to allow me to continue to develop game's into the future.

#### **Realms Online**

Realms Online will be the full Realms of Reality Experience.
