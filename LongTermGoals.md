### **Ancient Majik Tech**

I want to eventually create a game development company to allow me to protect my work as well as possible give other people a place to work to help me accieve my goals.

### **Realms of Reality Lore**

I plan on making a Lore set much like that of Blizard's DND, but Realms of Reality will be more tailored to 3D RPG games with a classless 'Skill based' system.

### **Quick Reaction Force**

Quick Reaction Force will be a 3D voxel Horror survival RPG Simulation based on a special event within the Realms of Reality lore.

### **Realms Engine**

Realms Engine will be a component based game engine which will be used to allow me to continue to develop game's into the future.

### **Realms Online**

Realms Online will be the full Realms of Reality Experience.
